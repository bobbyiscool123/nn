## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of Multidimensional Neural Networks (MNN), a novel neural network architecture designed to process high-dimensional data more efficiently than traditional approaches. By reshaping inputs into higher dimensions and processing them along different axes, MNNs can potentially reduce computational complexity while maintaining model expressiveness.

> **Note**: This project is currently in development. The training process has not yet begun as there are architectural issues that need to be addressed first.

## Features

- Implementation in both TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Support for shared and separate parameters across dimensions
- Parallel and sequential execution modes
- Customizable network architecture

## Documentation

- [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md)
- [Usage Examples](USAGE.md)
- [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Paper](paper.md) - Detailed explanation of the MNN concept

## Getting Started

```python
# Example code will be added soon
```
